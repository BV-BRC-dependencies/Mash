Mash is normally distributed as a binary for OSX or Linux the source is provided
here for non-standard systems or development.


Dependencies:
-------------
   - Autoconf ( http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ )
   - Cap'n Proto ( https://capnproto.org/ )
   - Zlib ( http://www.zlib.net/, included with OS X and most Linuxes )


Steps:
------
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ./configure [--prefix=...] [--with-capnp=...]
   make
   [sudo] make install


Products:
---------
   - command line tool ( <prefix>/bin/mash )
   - static library ( <prefix>/lib/libmash.a )
   - includes ( <prefix>/include/mash/ )


Deployment:
-----------
OSX
  HarvestTools can be built on any OSX version starting with 10.7 (using
  XCode >= 4.6), and the binary should work across the same range of versions,
  regardless of the particular version it was built with.
Linux
  Mash must be built with at least GCC 4.8 due to its c++11 dependency. However,
  the resulting binary can run on Linux with older GCC libraries if libstdc++ is
  linked statically. To do this, ensure that you have a statically built library
  (libstdc++.a) and add "-static-libstdc++" to $CPPFLAGS before running "make".
  You may also need to use "-L <dir>"in $CPPFLAGS to tell GCC where to find
  libstdc++.a.


Notes:
------
* When running ./configure, use --prefix to install somewhere other than
  /usr/local.
* Sudo will be necessary for 'make install' if write permission
  is not available in --prefix (e.g. by default).
* Use --with-capnp=... if the Cap'n Proto librariy is not in the default
  location (/usr/local). This should be an absolute path and should not include
  "bin" or "lib".
* If Zlib is not installed in a standard system location (it usually is),
  CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS will have to be modified before making.
